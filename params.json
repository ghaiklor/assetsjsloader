{"name":"AssetsJSLoader","tagline":"JS-loader for assets which loads CSS and JS files asynchronously","body":"AssetsJSLoader (AJL)\r\n====================\r\n\r\n**AJL** has been designed to simplify the management of loading javascript and css files. Its main feature is the ability to create your own packages of resources and load them only when necessary.\r\n\r\nAs a result of the AJL work you get separated logic of resource including (JS or CSS files) from the view and the only thing that connects you to your view it's script-tag which include AJL script.\r\n\r\nFeatures\r\n====================\r\n\r\n+ Support for the JS-files and CSS-files.\r\n+ Creating packages with the resources that you want to load.\r\n+ Ability to define which mode to load packages.\r\n+ Asynchronous loading of packages or not.\r\n+ Loading packages only after loading all resources on page (Lazy Loading).\r\n+ Built-in package manager will simplify the work with loading and creating packages.\r\n+ The ability to create their own namespaces with maximum ease and flexibility.\r\n+ Additional functions to verify the existence of namespace and set callback function when creating some namespace.\r\n+ You can use the shorthand for the most common functions. Such as creating package, set namespaces, loading the package or packages, etc.\r\n+ All code is thoroughly documented with examples.\r\n\r\nGetting Started\r\n====================\r\n\r\n1. Download the latest version from the **master** branch [here](https://github.com/ghaiklor/assetsjsloader/archive/master.zip) and connect it before the end of the body tag. The compiled file ready-2-use can be found in a *dist* directory with name **AJL.min.js**.\r\n\r\n2. Connect the file in the script tag and specify the **data-ep** attribute like this: `<script src=\"js/vendor/AJL.min.js\" data-ep=\"EntryPoint.js\"></script>`. **EntryPoint.js** file is loaded immediately after loading the AJL and this is where you can configure all the required packages and the necessary resources to load.\r\n\r\n3. Inside the file **EntryPoint.js**, set what packages you want to create and what to do when the page loads:\r\n\r\n```\r\nAJL({\r\n    name: \"jQuery\",\r\n    assets: ['js/vendor/jquery.min.js'],\r\n    config: {\r\n        async: false\r\n    }\r\n}, {\r\n    name: \"jQuery Plugins\",\r\n    assets: ['js/vendor/jquery.plugin.js', 'js/vendor/jquery.plugin2.js'],\r\n    config: {\r\n        depend: ['jQuery']\r\n    }\r\n}, {\r\n    name: \"My Scripts\",\r\n    assets: ['js/foo.js', 'js/bar.js'],\r\n    config: {\r\n        lazy: true\r\n    }\r\n}).loadAll();\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis configuration is only an example of AJL using. The above code will create three packages with names *jQuery*, *jQuery Plugins*, *My Scripts* and immediately load them with dependency resolution.\r\n\r\nConsider these three packages at a time.\r\n\r\nPackage named *jQuery* boot in the first place without the asynchronous loading.\r\n\r\nPackage with the *jQuery Plugins* name load all the plugins with this package, but only when the package with name *jQuery* is loaded because *jQuery Plugins* depends on *jQuery*.\r\n\r\nAnd last loaded package with the name *My Scripts* as it is configured to Lazy Loading. This means that *My Scripts* is loaded when all resources are loaded on the page, even with pictures.\r\n\r\nShorthand usage\r\n====================\r\n\r\nCurrently AJL supports four shorthands:\r\n\r\n1. `AJL();` - returns a PackageManager.\r\n\r\n2. `AJL(packageName);` - return a Package from PackageManager.\r\n\r\n3. `AJL(namespaceString, moduleObjectOrFunction);` - specify the namespace for an own module.\r\n\r\n4. `AJL(paramsForCreatingPackages, ..., etc, ...);` - create packages.\r\n\r\nMore information can be found [here](http://ghaiklor.github.io/assetsjsloader/doc/AJL.html).\r\n\r\nBuilt-in PackageManager\r\n====================\r\n\r\nFor get access to the integrated package manager enough to call a method with no parameters AJL(). Calling this function will return you the module AJL.PackageManager, that has all the necessary functions for working with packages:\r\n\r\n+ `getPackage(nameString);` - returns an AJL.Package object.\r\n\r\n+ `getPackages(namesArray);` - return an array of AJL.Package objects.\r\n\r\n+ `setPackage(AJLPackage);` - adds a new package in PackageManager or rewrite exists.\r\n\r\n+ `setPackages(AJLPackagesArray);` - adds a new packages in PackageManager or rewrite exists packages.\r\n\r\n+ `loadAll();` - load all packages in PackageManager.\r\n\r\n+ `loadByName(nameString);` - load package by name.\r\n\r\n+ `loadByNames(namesArray);` - load packages by their names.\r\n\r\nFor more information about these features can be found [here](http://ghaiklor.github.io/assetsjsloader/doc/AJL.PackageManager.html)\r\n\r\nNamespaces\r\n====================\r\n\r\nThere is also implemented namespaces are easy to use.\r\n\r\nEnough when developing your module call the function AJL() and pass it two parameters: the first is the string representation of the name of your namespace divided by dot **\".\"**, and the other option - it's the module (function or object).\r\n\r\nHere is an example module foo.js which we want to locate in window.**MyModule.SubModule**\r\n\r\n```\r\nAJL(\"MyModule.SubModule\", (function() {\r\n    var privateVariable = \"two\";\r\n    var foo = {\r\n        methodOne: function() {\r\n            console.debug(\"Method One\");\r\n        },\r\n        methodTwo: function() {\r\n            return privateVariable;\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n    return foo;\r\n})());\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe result of this code will be an object that is located in a global scope of window in MyModule.SubModule.\r\n\r\nAnd according to the use of your module can be reduced to such a is:\r\n\r\n```\r\nMyModule.SubModule.methodOne();\r\nMyModule.SubModule.methodTwo();\r\n```\r\n\r\nAlso, use the namespace ensures that there will be no leakage of variables, objects or functions in the global context **window**.\r\n\r\nDocumentation\r\n====================\r\n\r\nAll documentation is on this [link](http://ghaiklor.github.io/assetsjsloader/doc/AJL.html). Each class or namespace described in detail in this document and each method is an example of use.\r\n\r\nLicense\r\n====================\r\n\r\nThe MIT License (MIT)\r\n\r\nCopyright (c) 2013 Eugene Obrezkov\r\n\r\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\r\n\r\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\r\n\r\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\r\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
